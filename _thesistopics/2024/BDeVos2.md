#### Context

The field of condensed matter physics involves theoretical models to better understand quantum states of matter and critical phenomena, in particular phase transitions. Many of these models exhibit second-order phase transitions which can be described by a **conformal field theory** (CFT).  Most of these CFTs are (unitary) rational CFTs, and in particular minimal models. These models also commonly fall into so-called universality classes: a renormalisation group (RG) flow reduces a theory from its ultraviolet (UV) to its infrared (IR) limit, and only the universal properties remain. This flow converges to fixed points described by CFTs. The universality classes correspond to the models where the same CFT description holds after this RG flow. Within this context, the CFTs are defined to be real, since the running coupling parameter of the RG flow is a real number.

First-order phase transitions, however, cannot immediately be captured by these CFTs. These can be interpreted as transitions from conformal to non-conformal phases, or thus a loss of conformality. This can occur when an IR fixed point annihilates with a UV fixed point and they both disappear into the complex plane. [1] Approximate conformal invariance remains at the weak first-order transition, leading to a recent proposal that this behavior can be captured by a so-called **complex CFT**. [2] By analytically continuing the RG parameter to imaginary values, the flows will converge to these complex CFTs. This has been shown to apply to various condensed matter/statistical physics systems, as well as in high-energy physics. 

CFTs are particularly rich and useful in two dimensions, since they have an infinite amount of conserved quantities. These symmetry considerations allow us to make immense steps towards the solvability of the field theory. For this reason, the project will focus on the **two-dimensional Q-state Potts model**, which is a generalisation of the famous Ising model and has interesting ferromagnetic phase transition behavior depending on the value of $$Q$$. In particular, for $$Q > 4$$, the transitions are first-order and can be captured by complex CFTs. This has been shown analytically from the field theory perspective, [2] and recently lattice realisations of this behavior have been brought to attention. [3,4] 

#### Goal

This project will start off with a literature study into the relevance of complex conformal field theories, and particularly in the context of the Q-state Potts model. The student will first familiarise themselves with real CFT, and how these are related to criticality and renormalisation group. Afterwards, the student is fully equipped to tackle complex CFT. Finally, the student is asked to perform some original work related to [3], which can be approached from various angles, and especially from the numerical point of view. For example, a first step could be to reproduce [3] with **tensor networks**, a most popular theoretical and numerical toolbox that has been developed in our research group to study strongly correlated quantum systems.

The project can be tailored to the wishes and interests of the student in terms of which research topics they want to delve into. 

This project is well-suited for students with a keen interest in mathematical physics and theoretical physics. No prior knowledge on any of the mentioned topics above is required; a large part of this project concerns understanding these connections more deeply.

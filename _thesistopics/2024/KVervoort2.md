#### Context

The master thesis investigates the implementation of rigorous renormalization group (RRG) algorithm and its application to disordered models. Tensor Network (TN) methods [1] have been pivotal in understanding the behavior of various quantum many-body systems, especially in 1D. However it remains a challenge for traditional TN approaches to simulate models with strong disorder.
Recently an algorithm called rigorous renormalization group (RRG) [2,3] has been proposed for the analysis of disordered systems. This algorithm differs fundamentally from traditional TN algorithms. RRG does not utilize variational tensor network methods, instead it operates by constructing approximations of the global groundstate in a tree-like manner. This tree-like approach is able to tackle challenging problems like critical systems and disoredered systems, even outperforming traditional algorithms.

#### Goal

The overall goal of the thesis is to study and explore disordered quantum systems by RRG. The first part of the thesis consists of a literature study on RRG and disordered models. The student will try to make his own implementation of RRG by using the tensor network toolbox developed by our group. Secondly the student will need to compare the RRG method to standard TN approaches to identify the benefits of this approach. Lastly the student can explore a plethora of disordered models by using RRG, to get insight in the phase diagram and behaviour of these models.

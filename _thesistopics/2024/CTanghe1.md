#### Context

A central problem in quantum sciences and technology - whether it is in the context of quantum computing, quantum sensing or quantum experiments (quantum simulation) - is the preparation of a desired target quantum state using the limited available resources (time, experimental control). The new research field of **quantum control merges concepts of classical control theory with the intricacies of quantum physics** to find optimal preparation protocols. While quantum systems cover essentially all dynamics in the universe, this thesis will focus on **developing quantum control strategies inspired by** a particular application: **ultra-cold quantum many body states** (see e.g. [1-2]) **that we are creating in our Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) lab**.

In summary, a BEC consists of >10.000 bosonic atoms (Rb87 in our case) that are cooled to temperatures T<1 microKelvin. At these temperatures a new phase of matter emerges, the so called Bose-Einstein condensate, with all the atoms condensed into one collective quantum state. The unique feature of cold atom experiments such as ours is the high level of control: carefully tuned electromagnets and lasers provide many ‘knobs’ for manipulating the BEC and thereby realizing new experiments that can explore different aspects of the quantum realm. We have launched our experimental effort in 2022 and are now ready to start the first original experiments, in which quantum control will play a crucial role.

#### Goal

The goal of the thesis is to study, develp and apply control theory in the quantum context, in particular in the context of BEC physics. A specific quantum control task that we have in mind involves the coherent splitting of the BEC in two separate clouds (A and B), with a particular relative complex phase between the clouds. This relative phase can be interpreted as a piece of quantum data that is hidden in the correlation between A and B (see [3]), which can only be read out by looking at the interference patterns that emerge in time of flight images. The aim then is to design the optimal driving protocols that allow for maximal control on this relative phase. On the one hand this will entail simulations of the famous Gross-Pitaevskii equation (with existing numerical packages and/or within a to be determined approximation), that can describe the evolution of the BEC state under different driving conditions. On the other hand, the plan is also to test optimized driving protocols that come out of this numerical work in the actual experiment.

As such this thesis consists of **a blend of theory and numerical work in the context of quantum physics and quantum information, in combination with the unique opportunity to collaborate on a cutting-edge cold atom experiment**. Depending on the interest and skill of the student the topic can be oriented more towards theory, more towards numerics or more towards the actual experiment.

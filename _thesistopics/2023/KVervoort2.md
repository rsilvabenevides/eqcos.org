#### Context

Quantum key distribution (QKD) is one of the emerging quantum technologies with a high potential impact. The essence of QKD protocols is that the natural laws of quantum physics itself, with for instance the ‘no-cloning principle,’ according to which quantum information cannot be copied, provide a framework for secure communication. In our global digital world secure communication is of course of primordial importance. Furthermore, future quantum computers could break some of the classical cryptographic schemes that are currently widely used. All this motivates the current worldwide research efforts into QKD.

 

Any QKD protocol relies on the encoding of information in non-orthogonal quantum states. The best studied case is that of digital variables QKD (DVQKD), which makes use of states that live in a finite dimensional Hilbert space, e.g. the different polarization eigenstates of single photons. Alternatively, continuous variables QKD (CVQKD) makes use of states that live in an infinitely dimensional Hilbert space. Specifically, CVQKD relies on the production, transmission and detection of coherent laser pulses, which are indeed characterized by a continuous complex variable.

 

One advantage from the practical viewpoint is that CVQKD does not have to rely on single-photon detectors which are notoriously imperfect. Instead it uses so called homodyne or heterodyne detection of coherent laser pulses (with the information encoded in amplitude and phase). CVQKD can achieve high key rates over long distances using optical components at room temperature, making it a promising candidate for practical implementation in real-world communication systems. On the theoretical side it adds the twist of continuous variables to the quantum information theoretic analysis of QKD, with many open questions on the possible protocols and security proofs. As such the field of CVQKD research consists of an exciting blend of quantum information theory and quantum optics.

#### Goal

The overall goal of the thesis is to study and explore CVQKD. As part of the thesis the student will have the unique opportunity to experiment with a cutting-edge CVQKD system. In the context of a European research project we will have a test-link between campus Zwijnaarde and campus de Sterre, with CVQKD equipment at both nodes. One goal here is to understand and benchmark both the CVQKD system (e.g. what are the precise protocols it uses) and the test-link (e.g. what is the transmission loss). Another part of the thesis will entail a study of the literature on the existing CVQKD protocols and security proofs. Depending on the student’s preference and skill we can orient the project more towards theory or more towards experiment.

#### Context

In spring 2022 we have launched the first Belgian Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) experiment at UGent.
In summary, a BEC consists of >10.000 bosonic atoms (Rb87 in our case) that are cooled to temperatures T<1 microKelvin.
At these temperatures a new phase of matter emerges, the so called Bose-Einstein condensate, with all the atoms condensed into one collective quantum state.
The spectacular advances in controlling and manipulating the cold BEC atoms allow different exciting experiments on the dynamical behavior of quantum field theory (QFT), as realized by the bosonic QFT that describes the BEC physics.
Note that out-of-equilibrium QFT is currently a very active topic, relevant for a wide range of situations, from cosmology (e.g. inflation), over high-energy physics (e.g. heavy ion collisions) to condensed matter physics.
Apart from the large experimental control, the attractive aspect of cold atom experiments is that one can directly observe such processes in ‘real-time’, so to speak.

In our unique experimental set-up the precise control over the spatial confinement of the BEC is achieved by the combination of magnetic fields generated by an atom chip and a laser projection system.
The magnetic fields trap the atoms through the Zeeman effect while the light field repulses the atoms through the dipole interaction.
The light field is shaped using Acousto Optical Deflectors (AOD), allowing us to 'paint' flexible (both in space and time) potentials on the atom cloud.
See for example Ref [1] where they consider attractive light fields.

Having achieved the first milestone in our lab of creating a BEC, confined purely by the chip, we will now perturb those condensates with the laser projection system to study out-of-equilibrium processes.
In particular our AOD system, with its high temporal resolution, lends itself perfectly to the case of periodic driving, also known as Floquet dynamics.

- Images of an atom cloud that is cooled down by evaporating further and further (lowering the RF5-parameter). The onset of condensation is visible when a tight ellips of condensed atoms appears within the round distribution of thermal atoms. Evaporating even further, also condensed atoms are expelled from the trap.

#### Goal

The goal of this thesis is to apply the general theory of periodically driven quantum systems [2] to BEC physics and use this to guide actual experimental protocols on our set-up.

Some of the open questions are: depending on the driving period, what are the different dynamical regimes and how do they show up experimentally? ; depending on the driving period and the specific spatial profile, can we resonantly produce (single or pairwise) BEC excitations? ; in the case of short periods, can we use the formalism of Ref [2] to predict deviations from the time-averaged evolutions and possibly correct for them?

As such the thesis has a theoretical and numerical component.
First, the study of BEC physics: its description by the Gross-Piteavskii equation (GPE) (with existing easy to use numerical packages) and Bogoliubov theory [3], and second, the study and application of the Floquet framework.
In addition there is the unique opportunity to collaborate on a state-of-the-art quantum experiment.
Depending on their interests and skills, the student can focus more on the theoretical, numerical or experimental part.

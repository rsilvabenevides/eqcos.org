#### Context

Transport measurement is one of the most basic experimental tools to study materials, which, on the other hand, is often able to detect the most fundamental physics in materials. Two prominent examples are the superconductivity and the quantum Hall effect, which are both first discovered in transport experiments, and they have exhibited extremely rich and profound physics properties of the system. Besides the electronic current measurements, the spin transport is also utilized as effective experimental probes of quantum materials. The spin current has been utilized to detect different excitations which carry nonzero spin, including superconducting quasiparticles, magnons and spinons.

Given the importance of transport measurements, it would be desirable to develop a reliable theoretical approach to calculate these transport properties. For low-dimensional interacting systems, one choice is to compute the transport properties from real time simulations of the matrix product state (MPS). However, the entanglement entropy of the system typically grows linearly with the time, which leads to a exponential growth of the required bond dimension of the matrix product state. This expoential growth of the bond dimension typically limits the MPS real-time simulations to short time scales and small system sizes, and makes it very difficult to do quantum transport calculations based on MPS.

#### Goal

The goal of the thesis is to understand and employ the method proposed by Refs. [1, 2] and investigate how to extend it to spin transport in low-dimensional qauntum spin systems. One possible physical application of the approach is to study the spin transport property of the spin-1/2 antiferromagnetic Heisenberg chain at finite temperatures, and investigate its relation to the spinon excitations of the system.

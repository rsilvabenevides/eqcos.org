#### Context

Two-dimensional atomically-thin materials such as graphene and transition metal dichalcogenides (e.g. WSe2, MoTe2, ...) have been studied intensively both experimentally and theoretically since the seminal Nobel-prize winning work of Novoselov and Geim in 2004. However, initially most properties of these 2D materials could be explained using conventional nearly-free electron theories. This changed completely in 2018, when the group of Prof. Jarillo-Herrero at MIT showed that graphene becomes superconducing by combining different layers with a small rotational misalignment. Furthermore, twisted bilayer graphene shows insulating behaviour which (based on symmetry arguments) can only be explained by invoking strong interaction effects, i.e. these insulating states are strongly correlated and evade a simple free-electron description. This has opened an entirely new and fascinating world of strongly correlated electron physics, with a close connection between theory and experiment. For more details about twisted bilayer graphene, see this news feature published in Nature.


#### Goal

The goal of this project is use both numerical and analytical methods to study the connection between spontaneous symmetry breaking and unconventional superconductivity in twisted bilayer graphene. In particular, recent work by the supervisor of this project has identified a particular type of symmetry-breaking order, called the 'Incommensurate Kekulé Spiral' (IKS) order, which is responsible for the insulating behaviour of twisted bilayer graphene at integer electron fillings. This IKS order has indeed recently been observed experimentally in scanning tunneling microscopy experiments performed by the group of Ali Yazdani at Princeton University. 

An important property of the IKS order is that it spontaneously breaks several continuous symmetries (such as for example spin rotation symmetry). When such spontaneous symmetry breaking takes place, the electronic system will have low-energy collective modes which correspond to Goldstone modes of the broken symmetry. The goal is to study these Goldstone modes in the IKS ordered state via a generalized random phase approximation and the resulting Bethe-Salpeter equation. From the solutions of the Bethe-Salpeter equation, one can construct an effective model which describes the interaction between the electrons in the IKS state and the Goldstone modes, and examine whether these Goldstone modes could be responsible for electron pairing and superconductivity, similarly to how the interaction between electrons and phonons leads to superconductivity in standard elemental superconductors such as for example aluminum.

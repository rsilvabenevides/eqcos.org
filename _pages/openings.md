# Open Positions

**We are currently accepting applications for Master’s and Ph.D. positions related to our FAPESP grant.**

<p style="text-align: justify;"> In our group, you will have the opportunity to develop several skills. We work with cryogenic tools to explore the quantum features of distinct systems, which we microfabricated ourselves. We are looking for students eager to participate in a collaborative and inclusive environment, where we can have a lot of fun while doing great science! </p>  

<p style="text-align: justify;">We encourage students from diverse backgrounds to join the team, including individuals of different gender identities, sexual orientations, and ethnicities. The more diverse our environment, the richer our thoughts. Science thrives on diversity!</p>

<!-- ## Ph.D. Positions -->

<!-- ### Electromechanical Devices for Microwave-Optical Transduction
<!-- #### Funding: FAPESP -->
<!-- <p style="text-align: justify;">The student participating in this project will work on developing an electromechanical device designed to operate in the quantum regime. They will also contribute to building the laboratory infrastructure, with a focus on cryogenic and microwave setups. The ultimate goal is to perform electromechanical experiments and achieve microwave-optical transduction in the quantum regime.</p> -->

<!-- <div style="text-align: justify;">

<p style="text-align: justify;margin-top: 25px;">In this project, the student will learn and develop a diverse set of skills, including:</p>

* Learning the quantization of electrical circuits and the fundamentals of circuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED). 
* Analyzing the electromechanical Hamiltonian, with numerical simulations of our system.
* Designing and numerically simulating the superconducting devices to be fabricated.
* Developing microfabrication techniques for superconducting circuits using Josephson junctions.
* Assisting in the construction of a cryogenic environment compatible with cQED experiments. 
* Performing experiments on coherent microwave photon-phonon conversion in electromechanical devices.

<u>Desired previous experience:</u> While not mandatory, the ideal candidate is expected to have some prior experimental experience, such as a Master’s or Bachelor’s thesis in experimental physics. Basic knowledge of microfabrication processes and Python programming is also a significant advantage.  --> -->

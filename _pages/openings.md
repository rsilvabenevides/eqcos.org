# Open positions

**We are currently open for master and Ph.D. applications related to our FAPESP grant.**

<p style="text-align: justify;"> In our group, you will have the opportunity to develop several skills. We work with cryogenic tools to explore the quantum features of distinct systems, microfabricated by ourselves. We want student willing to participate in a collaborative and inclusive environment, where we can have a lot of fun while doing great science :) </p>  

## Ph.D positions

### Electromechanical devices for microwave-optical transduction
#### Funding: FAPESP
<p style="text-align: justify;">The student involved in this scholarship proposal will work toward building an electromechanical
device that can be operated at the quantum regime. They will also help to build the laboratory
infrastructure, with a focus on the cryogenic and microwave setups. The final goal is to perform electromechanical
experiments and microwave-optical transduction in the quantum regime.</p>

<div style="text-align: justify;">

<p style="text-align: justify;margin-top: 25px;">In this project, the student will learn and develop a diverse set of skills, including:</p>

* Understand the quantization of electrical circuits and the fundamentals of circuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED). 
* Study the electromechanical Hamiltonian, with numerical simulations of our system.
* Design and numerically simulate the superconducting devices to be fabricated.
* Develop the microfabrication of superconducting circuits using Josephson junctions.
* Help in the construction of a cryogenic environment compatible with cQED experiments. 
* Coherent microwave photon-phonon conversion in electromechanical devices.

<u>Desired previous experience:</u> While not mandatory, the sucessful candidate is expected to have some previous experimental experience, with a master or bachelor thesis in experimental physics. Basic knowledge of microfabrication processes and Python coding    is also a big plus. 

## Master positions

### Optomechanics with surface acoustic waves
#### Funding: FAPESP
<p style="text-align: justify;">The student involved in this proposal will work toward building an optomechanical device that
can be operated at the quantum regime. They will also help to build the laboratory infrastructure,
with a focus on the optical setups. The final goal is to perform optomechanical experiments that form
the basis of the transduction process.</p>

  <figcaption style="font-size: 16px; color: #555; display: block; text-align: center; margin-top: -35px;"> Schematic of the optomechanical device.

<div style="text-align: justify;">

<p style="text-align: justify;margin-top: 25px;">In this project, the student will learn and develop a diverse set of skills, including:</p>

* Study optical cavities, learning basic concepts. 
* Understand the optomechanical Hamiltonian, with numerical simulations of our system.
* Develop the microfabrication of micromirrors.
* Fabricate optomechanical devices.
* Measurement of optomechanical devices at room temperature.
* Cryogenic measurements of optomechanical devices, with single-phonon level experiments.

<p style="text-align: justify;">If you are interested in working with us as a master's or PhD student, please send me an [email](mailto:rsilvabenevides@gmail.com). State briefly why you are interested and attach a CV, including information about the grades you had as an undergraduate. No need for a separate cover letter or certificates. **Important**: Please insert _"Application PhD"_ or _"Application Master"_ in the subject line.</p>

### Bachelor projects
<p style="text-align: justify;">We are always open for new bachelor students. At the moment, we can offer the following projects:</p>

* <u>Introduction to circuit quantum electrodynamics</u>: The student will learn how to quantize electrical circuits and the fundamentals of superconducting circuits and qubits. 
* <u>Simulations of superconducting qubits</u>: The student will help in the numerical simulation of the superconducting devices we will fabricate. This will include finite element method simulations and some Python coding. 
* <u>Introduction to quantum transduction</u>: The student will learn what are the constrains and think in possible solutions for the difficult problem of transducing quantum states.

<p style="text-align: justify;"> And we are always to discuss particular interests of students wanting to join the team. Just drop by to discuss with us!</p>

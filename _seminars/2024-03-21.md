Topological flat bands at the Fermi level offer a promising platform to study strongly correlated phases of matter. Diverging from the extensively examined K-valley systems such as graphene and most Transition Metal Dichalcogenides, our study pivots to Gamma-valley moiré systems. We explore various systems including the Dirac surface state of topological insulators, the anisotropic bands of black phosphorus and multi-orbital semiconductors. Within the Dirac surface state, we observe that the interplay between Zeeman and scalar terms within a honeycomb can simulate topological bands in honeycomb lattice. In the twisted bilayer black phosphorus, the system displays giant anisotropic moiré bands, which can further simulate a sliding Luttinger liquid. For the multi-orbital system, the system can support a moiré Kagome lattice and an orbital-active honeycomb lattice, depending on parameters. Finally, we employ the Hartree-Fock method to discuss the impact of Coulomb interactions on the moiré Kagome systems and present phase diagrams for various fillings. Our explorations open up new pathways in the study of Gamma-valley Moiré systems.

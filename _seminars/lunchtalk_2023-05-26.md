I will give a review of the recent developments in deriving emergent large scales hydrodynamics for quantum (and classical) interacting many-body systems, with a special focus on integrable and chaotic one-dimensional systems. In particular I will show how at large scales, interacting systems can display exotic types of fluctuations, which identify with known universality classes of non-equilibrium classical stochastic systems.

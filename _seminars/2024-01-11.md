The study of interacting quantum Hall states and their exotic anyonic excitations poses a major challenge in current experimental and theoretical research. Quantum simulators, in particular ultracold atoms, provide a promising platform to realize, manipulate, and understand such systems with a high controllability. In many cases, the experimental platforms use lattices, so that a theoretical understanding of the connection between continuum quantum Hall states and their lattice analogs - called Chern insulators - is desirable.
A near-term goal for theory is to find suitable observables to directly probe the topological properties of exotic states of matter. To this end, I will propose new directions available in state-of-the-art experiments, focusing specifically on two examples.
First, I will present results for the Laughlin state showing that at magnetic filling factor $\nu=1/2$ three-legged systems are sufficient to realize and probe properties of central interest in interacting topological systems, like the central charge [1]. I will also address the hidden order in FQH states and how it can be detected with snapshots obtained via perfect sampling from an MPS [2]. Afterwards, I will discuss a bosonic analog of the Pfaffian state at filling factor $ \nu=1$, which was long studied as a candidate state for the fermionic $\nu=5/2$ plateau and may provide a route towards non-Abelian anyon braiding [3].

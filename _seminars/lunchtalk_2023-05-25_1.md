Hamiltonian simulation is a promising application for quantum computers to achieve a quantum advantage. In this talk we will present classical algorithms based on tensor network methods to optimize quantum circuits for this task. We show that, compared to Trotter product formulas, the classically optimized circuits can be orders of magnitude more accurate and significantly extend the total simulation time.
